## Web API Quiz

This week's homework was all about Javascript, API's, Local Storage and Dom manipulation.

This quiz is almost all Java script.  I queried the HTML elements and then added and changed them.

I used a loop that went through and array. Each position of the array contained an opject with questions and answers.

I utilized Local storage to store the score of the player in the game as well as for the imput score list at the end.

To be honest this was the hardest homework to date for me.  Wrapping my head around dynamically changing a site with a loop and then appending or removing those elements was hard to grasp. I did end up using two html pages.  One for the quiz and one for the scorboard.  I used an example from class as a boiler plate for the scoreboard and I didnt feel far enough in my skill level to incorporate it all into one page.


I will say I did learn alot. I used boostrap and CSS to format the page. I didnt spend alot of time on this as I felt the criticallity of the assignment was the functionality
